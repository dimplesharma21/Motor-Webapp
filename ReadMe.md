Motor WebApp 

A small webapp made while learning to make dynamic websites. A new motor can be added dynamically. Every motor has a start (on), stop (off) button and speed increment/decrement buttons. Speed can be incremented/decremented only when motor is switched on. Each motor's health can be checked. If the speed crosses 10, motor's health will be indicated in red color, else green color. There's a fix health button which will reduce the speed of motor to 5 and hence, it's health would be indicated in green.

//npm install
//nodemon app.js (or) node app.js
//localhost 3000
